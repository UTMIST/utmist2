Welcome to the UTMIST Engineering Department, where talent meets creativity and produce amazing projects!

Our projects are self-directed experiences where talented students experiment their ideas using machine intelligence and pitch their projects to our industry partners at the Annual Project Showcase. Each year, student directors submit proposals and recruit their own team of developers to work on their topic of choice in a 6-month development cycle. Potential projects move on after the first cycle and progress towards product deployment or academic publications.

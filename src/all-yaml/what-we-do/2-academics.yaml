It is the duty of every scientist to pay back research debt. Our approach is through teaching and mentorship. We are a group of student researchers (who love to teach!), curating academic content to create the next generation of students passionate about ML!

We tackle the hottest AI topics such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Diffusion Models (DMs), presenting them in an inspiring, intuitive, and easy-to-digest manner for a wide audience of students.

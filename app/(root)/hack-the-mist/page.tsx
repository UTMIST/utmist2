                        This is UTMIST's first large-scale hackathon where participants will focus on developing an end-to-end solution for a 
                        real-world problem with ML. This will be an all-inclusive hackathon where we invite hackers from all backgrounds. You 
                        will get a chance to learn about building full ML pipelines for real-world applications in the domain of NLP, Climate 
                        Change, and Art, which is not something that is taught in university courses. We will host a range of events including 
                        Speaker Panels, workshops to develop both technical and business acumen, networking sessions and a social gathering for 
                        participants.
